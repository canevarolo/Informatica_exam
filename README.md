# Informatica exam
A repository with all my codes for the exam of "Informatica" (Computer sciences) in the first year of Bachelors in engineering courses, at Politecnico di Torino.
All the codes were executed back in 2019 using the application "Codeblocks".

Here only the file "main" will be uploaded, but in normal codes there were other files with other extensions, like .cbp .

Since the course was taught in italian, all the exercises will be in italian. Maybe, one day, I'll translate them :)
